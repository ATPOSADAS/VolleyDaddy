# VolleyDaddy


## Overview

VolleyDaddyâ€™s goal is to serve as a planning application for a volleyball team. The main purpose of the app is to allow a coach or team captain to plan out their rotation scheme for a given team. The app will allow users to adjust player positions within the constraints of volleyball rules, as well as animate the rotations/transitions from one positioning to the next. Users will be able to adjust each of the six player circles from their default/textbook rotation positions, or start from templates such as a 5-1 or 6-2 offense.
